# Week9JDBCtoMySQLUpdates
This week in MySQL we learned how to write a menu-drive application, with exception handling. We implemented a scanner to get user input. We learned how to use BigDecimal objects. We used JDBC to handle resources, such as Connections and PreparedStatements. We also implemented JDBC methods to insert an object into a table.
